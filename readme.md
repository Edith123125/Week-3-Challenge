## Features
-Display Movie Details: Automatically shows the details of the first movie when the page loads.
  
- Ticket Booking System: Users can purchase tickets for a selected movie,the available ticket count updates dynamically and if tickets are sold out, the button is disabled and a "SOLD OUT" message is displayed.

- Dynamic Movie List:Fetches a list of movies from a JSON server and displays them in an interactive list.
